I was talking to a friend about Wisconsin, their insistence on coal-fired power plants, and how great dairy is when I wondered which produces more CO2, Wisconsin's cows or power plants?
So I decided to do the math. Now, I must note that these numbers may not be perfect, only some brief research was included.
Never-the-less, here is the math.
<br><br>
<code>
    Numbers of Cows<br>
    1.26 m dairy cows<br>
    0.31 m beef cows<br><br>
    Carbon Impact of Cows by Protein<br>
    9 g CO2-Ceq per g protein dairy<br>
    62 g CO2-Ceq per g protein beef<br><br>
    Output of a Cow<br>
    2300 gal milk per cow per year<br>
    430 pounds beef per cow<br><br>
    Protein of Cow Outputs<br>
    128 g protein per gallon milk<br>
    ~100 g protein per pound beef<br><br>
    Protein in Output of One Cow<br>
    294400 g protein of milk per cow per year<br>
    43000 g protein of beef per cow per year<br><br>
    Carbon Impact of Cow<br>
    2.649 m g CO2-Ceq per dairy cow per year<br>
    2.666 m g CO2-Ceq per beef cow<br><br>
    Carbon Impact of Wisconsin Cows<br>
    3.338 t g CO2-Ceq by dairy cows in Wisconsin per year<br>
    0.826 t g CO2-Ceq by beef cows in Wisconsin<br>
    4.165 t g CO2-Ceq by cows in Wisconsin<br>
    <b>9.182 b lbs CO2 generated by cows in Wisconsin</b><br><br>
    Wisconsin Coal Production<br>
    2.241 m MWh electricity generated by coal in Wisconsin<br>
    2.241 b kWh electricity generated by coal in Wisconsin<br><br>
    Carbon Impact of Coal<br>
    2.21 lbs CO2 per kWh coal electricity<br>
    <b>4.953 b lbs CO2 generated by coal in Wisconsin</b><br><br>
    <b>1.854x more CO2 generated by cows than coal in Wisconsin</b>
</code>
<br><br>
First, it was reaffirming that the carbon impact of a cow ended up being nearly the same whether the cow was used for dairy or beef production.
I was impressed that the two ended up on the same order of magnitude and even more impressed that I was right.
