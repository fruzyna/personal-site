I've for quite a while now used Wireguard to configure, but generally I used someone else's work to generate myself a config.
But I wanted to know how it actually works and take advantage of some of the more advanced features of Wireguard.
So I learned a lot, built a script, and am going to share it with you.
<h2>Our Model</h2>
There are many different ways to configure a Wireguard network, but here I will focus on a single client-server style model.
In this model there is one client where the host has an open port and N clients.
The clients connect to the "server" and route specified traffic through it.
<h2>Configuration</h2>
The easiest way to configure Wireguard (in my opinion) is to create a config file at <code>/etc/wireguard/wg0.conf</code>.
Then once configured the Wireguard interface can be brought up/down with <code>wg-quick up/down wg0</code>.
I believe any name can be used for the config here, but <code>wg0</code> is the default name of sorts.
<br>
These configuration files have two sections, <code>[Interface]</code> and <code>[Peer]</code>s.
The interface section describes the Wireguard interface on the host.
This always includes its address and private key.
In the case of a server it includes a port and in the case of a client it includes a DNS address.
<br><br>
<code>
[Interface]<br>
Address = 192.168.1.1<br>
ListenPort = 51820<br>
PrivateKey = SERVER_PRIVATE_KEY=<br>
<br>
[Peer]<br>
PublicKey = CLIENT_PUBLIC_KEY=<br>
AllowedIPs = 192.168.1.2/32
</code>
<br><br>
Peers on the other hand describe other Wireguard clients networked with the host.
These always include a public key and allowed IPs (IPs that are routed to that peer).
For clients there will also be an end point to route traffic through.
This IP address could be an external or internal IP, depending on if the client is on the same network or not.
<br><br>
<code>
[Interface]<br>
Address = 192.168.7.2<br>
PrivateKey = CLIENT_PRIVATE_KEY=<br>
DNS = 1.1.1.1<br>
<br>
[Peer]<br>
PublicKey = SERVER_PUBLIC_KEY=<br>
EndPoint = SERVER_ADDRESS:51820<br>
AllowedIPs = 0.0.0.0/0
</code>
<h3>Allowed IPs</h3>
As mentioned before, all peer sections should define a set of allowed IPs.
This value is a comma-separated list of IPs which traffic destined for should be routed through this peer.
For example, generally on the host side there is one peer per client and a single allowed IP for each, representing the IP address of the client.
This means that only traffic destined for the client is routed to the client.
On the client side generally a range of IPs is routed back to the server.
Here the allowed IP could be a range just representing the Wireguard subnet (like <code>192.168.1.0/24</code>) or representing all traffic (like <code>0.0.0.0/0</code>).
<h4>Communicating with Peers on Clients' Other Interfaces</h4>
The beauty of Wireguard is that you only need the single host open to the internet to route just about any traffic around.
For example, if you have the server on one network "A" and a client on another network "B" Wireguard can be configured to route traffic destined for other (not connected to Wireguard) devices on B from anywhere on the Wireguard network.
First, on the server side add the B network subnet (like <code>192.168.2.0/24</code>) to the allowed IPs list for the peer representing the Wireguard client on that network.
Then, on the client side add post up and post down iptables commands to the interface section using the interface connected to network B.
<br><br>
<code>
PostUp = iptables -A FORWARD -i %i -j ACCEPT; iptables -A FORWARD -o %i -j ACCEPT; iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o [B_INTERFACE] -j MASQUERADE<br>
PostDown = iptables -D FORWARD -i %i -j ACCEPT; iptables -D FORWARD -o %i -j ACCEPT; iptables -t nat -D POSTROUTING -o [B_INTERFACE] -j MASQUERADE
</code>
<br><br>
I don't fully understand these commands but from my understanding when the Wireguard interface is brought up/down route all incoming traffic on the Wireguard interface through to B_INTERFACE.
<h3>Preshared Keys</h3>
For additional security a preshared key can be generated and shared between a single pair of peers.
In this configuration a key is shared between the peer sections of the server and each respective client.
<br><br>
<code>PresharedKey = PRESHARED_KEY=</code>
<h2>Generating Public/Private and Preshared Keys</h2>
A private and public key will need to be generated for each peer on the Wireguard network.
First, the private key is generated with the following.
<br><br>
<code>(umask 0077; wg genkey > NAME.key)</code>
<br><br>
Then, the public key is generated using the private key.
<br><br>
<code>wg pubkey < NAME.key > NAME.pub</code>
<br><br>
These commands will each create a file containing the string used for the keys in the config file.
Preshared keys are generated using the same command as private keys, but no corresponding key is needed.
<br><br>
<code>(umask 0077; wg genpsk > NAME.psk)</code>
<h2>Generating a QR Code of Configuration File</h2>
The easiest way to move a config file to a mobile client is with a QR code.
<br><br>
<code>qrencode -t ansiutf8 -r NAME.conf</code>
<h2>The Script</h2>
As alluded to, I put this knowledge I learned into - what I consider - a convienent script.
The script can be <a href="https://gist.github.com/fruzyna/e8ebfae37d41c918b80ee9c3d3aa4ccf">found here</a>.
First, the script has a range of constants that should be defined before use.
Some of these constants can be overriden with parameters but the intended use case is having a static script in a directory containing all configuration files.
This way new configuration for additional peers can be quickly generated without remembering every parameter used.
Once parameters are processed, the script generates a private, public, and shared key.
Then it looks for a server config file, if that does not exist a new one is generated.
Next the script counts existing config files to determine the IP address of the new peer.
The new client's config file is generated, then the peer is added to the server's config file.
Finally, a QR code is generated.
