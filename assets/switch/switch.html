<h2>Why I bought it</h2>
I was hesitant to buy a Switch Lite.
I have wanted a Switch since it came out.
Nintendo IP is great, but there hadn't been any particular IPs pulling me toward the Switch.
This changed when Animal Crossing New Horizons came out.
I have played every Animal Crossing game and have owned the last three.
Plus, I have a real job now and had no excuse to avoid paying for a Switch.
I had convinced myself to pay the extra $100 for a normal Switch but those are impossible to find right now so I ended up with a Yellow Switch Lite along with Animal Crossing New Horizons of course.

<h2>Build Quality</h2>
This is my favorite Nintendo handheld ever.
I have owned a Gameboy Advance, Gameboy Advance SP, DS Lite, DSi, and 3DS and nothing comes close to the Switch Lite.
I have held a few normal Switches as well and the Lite is an improvement over it too.
In my hands it feels a lot like a grown-up Gameboy Advance which is likely because it's my first Nintendo handheld that doesn't fold since the GBA.
The matte plastic is very comfortable in the hand and despite not having much in the way of ergonomic features it sits very comfortable in the hands with the slight lip behind the shoulder buttons and the round corners on the bottom.
There are no Joycons that slide off but that allows it to be so much more compact and polished feeling.
The touch screen feels fine without feeling fragile and all the buttons click great.
The joysticks are a bit shallow and their limits feel almost hexagonal but they are better than those on the 3DS.
There are flaps over the MicroSD card and game card slots which look nice but feel like they are barely holding on with their clips.
There are stereo speakers and a USB C port on the bottom, grills on the back, and a headphone jack and vent on top.
The two grills on the back give a symmetric appearance, but it is a shame that only about half of one is functional.
A final minor note is there is a slight cutout in the bottom of the device to place its serial number and barcode, it makes it feel slightly best polished but is barely noticable.
<h2>It doesn't switch!</h2>
The big difference in the Lite is the fact that it doesn't \"switch\" at all.
And for me this isn't a problem whatsoever.
The only game I have bought is Animal Crossing and that game absolutely does not need to be on the big screen.
Now, the Switch has incredible couch co-op support and I think it is the perfect party console for games like Overcooked, Jackbox, and Speedrunners.
I love these kinds of games, but I already own them on my much more powerful PC.
Plus, as a college graduate I don't have many people around to play these games anyways.
<h2>USB C</h2>
USB C is great and on the Switch Lite it does provide more than power, unlike some devices, but it isn't very great.
Of course it does not support video out, but I also was unable to get my USB C headphones to work and connecting it to my phone only allowed me to charge my phone.
I was able to get an ethernet connection to work and my understanding is that keyboards work too. But the limited functionality is disappointing.
<h2>Battery Life</h2>
The battery life kinda sucks. I got probably about 5 hours on Animal Crossing which is fine but it felt like I was charging it all the time.
Standby power also was not a strong point.
This was one of my hesitations about the Lite over the Switch but it's not that big of a deal.
<h2>Operating System</h2>
This hardware has a ton of potential and I think the OS is really limiting it.
I thought it was so cool that the original Switch could be hacked to run Linux or Android and my dream was to use a Switch as a portable Steam Link.
Unfortunately, this is not possible without a hardware modification on the Lite.
The eShop allows you to buy about any Switch title digitally but its pretty slow and the non-cartridge software is limited.
The interface is pretty well done but can feel a bit fragmented.
But the stunner is a lack of a web browser.
Every Nintendo device since the DS has had a web browser in some capacity and while it is true that there is one on the Switch it is really only designed for WiFi network login.
There is also no real multitasking much like on the 3DS.
All of this combined makes the Switch feel more like a Gameboy than an Android tablet, which the hardware is built out a lot more like.
One plus is the built in screenshot button, it makes it super easy to grab a click of what just happened on the screen and does support some limited sharing functionality.
<h2>Nintendo Online</h2>
As usual Nintendo's online services are rough and this time they are even charging for them.
Fortunately the price is reasonable and it comes with virtual NES and SNES consoles.
<h2>Screen</h2>
The screen is fine. It is 720p which is disappointingly low, but still looks fine if you don't hold it too close and allows the Switch to run pretty comfortably.
I think the size if perfect, any bigger and it would feel clunky like the original Switch, and any smaller and it would feel like a toy.
The screen didn't feel particularly fast and the blacks aren't that dark, but the colors seemed vibrant.
<h2>Months Later</h2>
I wrote this review at least 4 months ago and never finished it.
Coming from a perspective of months of use, the console has held up really well.
Beyond a slight polishing where it sits, there is no noticeable wear on the body and buttons are still as clicky as ever.
I do have to say that the shoulder buttons are disappointing, they are not nearly as tactile as the other buttons.
While I have yet to experience joystick drift the joysticks have been smoothed down a bit, but the wear is not very noticable.
Animal Crossing is still the only game I have purchased for it, but I do plan on buying Super Mario 3D All-Stars soon.
