One of the core features of <a href="https://github.com/wildstang/wildrank">WildRank</a> is that the app should be fully offline compatible.
A problem I discovered while using version 1 at the various competitions this year is how do you update an out of date installation while offline?
<br><br>
Offline PWAs use <code>CacheStorage</code> to add new files to the browser's cache when they are fetched using function <code>add()</code>, <code>addAll()</code>, and <code>put()</code>.
These functions normally take a <code>URL</code> and or a <code>Response</code> to cache away an actual response from the web server.
But this is not possible if the application is offline and the server is not present.
<br><br>
WildRank imports app offline updates via a zip archive.
When opened the files in the zip are represented as a <code>Blob</code> which are effectively JS representations of files.
Luckily, a <code>Response</code> can be manually constructed around a <code>Blob</code>.
But the <code>Blob</code> alone won't tell the browser enough about the file to pull it from the cache.
<code>Headers</code>, just like those returned in a <code>GET</code> request, must also be present to describe the file.
<code>Content-Type</code>, containing the mime-type of the file, and <code>Content-Length</code> containing the length in bytes of the file, must be in the header.
Here is the completed example:
<br>
<code style="white-space: pre-wrap">
let cache = await caches.open('cache_name')<br>
let content = new Blob()

let headers = new Headers()
headers.append('Content-Type', 'application/javascript')
headers.append('Content-Length', content.size)

let res = new Response(content, { statusText: 'OK', headers: headers })
cache.put(new URL('https://url/path/to/file'), res)
</code>
